## Introduction

## History of MATLAB

## Where it is Used
MATLAB is used in a variety of cases. Its most frequent use is in image, data processing, and graphical representation of data in various applications including the following categories:\ 

Embedded Systems\
Control Systems\
Digital Signal Processing\
Wireless Communications\

Linear Algebra\
Specifically Matlab shines when having to vectorize data through matrices using Linear Algebra. "Linear algebra functions in MATLAB provide fast, numerically robust matrix calculations. Capabilities include a variety of matrix factorizations, linear equation solving, computation of eigenvalues or singular values, and more."\

MATLAB contains functions, such as mldivide, for linear algebra. mldivide is simply called using the syntax:\
Input:\
A = sparse([0 2 0 1 0; 4 -1 -1 0 0; 0 0 0 3 -6; -2 0 0 0 2; 0 0 4 2 0]);\
B = sparse([8; -1; -18; 8; 20]);\
x = A\B

Output:\
x = \
   (1,1)       1.0000\
   (2,1)       2.0000\
   (3,1)       3.0000\
   (4,1)       4.0000\
   (5,1)       5.0000\

Embedded Systems\
In embedded systems MATLAB can be used in conjunction with built in code generators (from out of the box) or with third party libraries to generate C/C++ code for optimal embedded systems code. Some examples of embedded systems are washing machines, printers, automobiles, cameras, industrial machines, etc. \
